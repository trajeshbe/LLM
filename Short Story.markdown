# The Tale of Aadhan and Thamarai

Lets write a short story. Wait, Lets ask ChatGPT to write a story. Lets just prompt it with a plot and allow the it to complete it. The idea is to create the story in two parts , we will use the Part 1 data for finetuning the LLM and part 2 for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Once the story is written, we can ask it to setup some question and answer dataset within the story which we can use it for finetuning and for Retrieval Augmented Generation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is the plot:

**Once upon a time, there lived a king named Aadhan and he ruled a county named Kandigai in southern part of Tamil Nadu, India. Aadhan was a noble king. He had a brother Amudhan. He was wicked and cunning. He always partnered with bad people and tried to kill his brother to full fill his wish of becoming a king. Aadhan fell in love with a ordinary girl Thamarai. Amudhan framed Thamarai in a conspiracy. At one point of time, Aadhan was forced to choose between Kingdom vs Thamarai by Amudhan by foul play and he gave up kingdom and choose to live his life with Thamarai.**

## Part 1: A Kingdom Reclaimed

Once upon a time, there lived a king named Aadhan who ruled over the county of Kandigai in the southern part of Tamil Nadu, India. Aadhan was known far and wide for his noble character and just rule. However, he had a brother named Amudhan who harbored dark ambitions.

Amudhan, driven by greed and cunning, conspired to seize the throne from his brother. He allied himself with nefarious individuals and plotted against Aadhan, seeking to eliminate him and claim the kingdom for himself.

Meanwhile, Aadhan, oblivious to his brother's treachery, found love in the most unexpected of places. He met and fell in love with Thamarai, a simple and ordinary girl whose kindness and beauty captured his heart.

As their love blossomed, so did Amudhan's schemes. He framed Thamarai in a conspiracy, hoping to tarnish Aadhan's reputation and weaken his hold on the throne. Aadhan, torn between his duty to the kingdom and his love for Thamarai, faced an impossible choice.

In a moment of clarity, Aadhan realized that true power lay not in the trappings of kingship, but in the love and compassion he shared with Thamarai. He made the ultimate sacrifice, renouncing his claim to the throne and choosing to live a humble life with his beloved.

Together, Aadhan and Thamarai retreated to a serene village, far from the political machinations of Kandigai. They found solace in each other's company, embracing the simple joys of life and reveling in their newfound freedom.

However, their idyllic existence was soon shattered by news of Amudhan's tyranny. With Aadhan gone, Amudhan seized control of the kingdom, ruling with an iron fist and subjecting the people to his ruthless whims.

Driven by a sense of duty and justice, Aadhan resolved to confront his brother and reclaim his rightful place as the king of Kandigai. With Thamarai by his side, he embarked on a perilous journey back to his homeland, where he found the kingdom in turmoil.

Despite facing numerous challenges and dangers, Aadhan remained steadfast in his quest to overthrow Amudhan's oppressive regime. With the support of loyal allies and the unwavering determination of the people, he led a rebellion against his brother's forces, culminating in a climactic showdown for the throne.

In a dramatic duel, Aadhan emerged victorious, defeating Amudhan and restoring peace and prosperity to Kandigai. With Thamarai's love as his guiding light, he ruled with wisdom and compassion, ensuring that the kingdom flourished under his just and benevolent reign.
